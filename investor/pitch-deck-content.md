## Slide 2: The Problem

### Traditional Companies Are Broken

**Slow:**
- Product development: 6-12 months
- Hiring: 2-3 months per role
- Decision cycles: weeks of meetings

**Expensive:**
- Average startup burn: $100-300K/month
- 70% of costs = salaries
- Office, benefits, overhead

**Limited:**
- Work only 40-50 hours/week
- Timezone constraints
- Human capacity plateaus

> **In 2026, the bottleneck isn't technology. It's human bandwidth.**

## Slide 3: The Solution

### AI-First Company Operations

**MUIN is the world's first AI-operated company:**
- 1 human CEO (strategy)
- 1 AI COO (operations)
- 12+ AI agents (execution)

**Not "AI-assisted." AI-operated.**

We don't use AI as a tool.  
**AI runs the company. The human sets the vision.**
