# 무인기업 (MUIN) - Investor One-Pager

**"일하는 AI, 누리는 인간" — Run by AI, for humans**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional startups face a brutal equation:
- **Hiring costs:** ₩60-100M/year per engineer
- **Speed bottleneck:** Human coordination overhead
- **Scale limits:** Linear cost increase with team size

Meanwhile, AI capabilities have reached a tipping point where autonomous operation is now possible.

## 💡 The Solution

**MUIN is the world's first 100% AI-operated company.**

Not "AI-assisted" — **AI-operated**. One human founder (ONE) sets strategy. AI COO (MJ) handles everything else: coding, marketing, operations, shipping products.
