## 📰 Press Release

### MUIN Launches Privacy Shield for AI Conversations

**Seoul, South Korea - February 2026** - MUIN, an AI-first company, today announced the launch of MUIN Guard, a free Chrome extension that protects users from accidentally exposing sensitive information during AI conversations.

As AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude become indispensable tools for millions of users, a new privacy risk has emerged: accidental data exposure. Users frequently paste API keys, personal information, and confidential data into AI chats without realizing the potential consequences.

MUIN Guard addresses this problem with real-time detection of 30+ risk patterns, including:
- API keys and authentication tokens
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Dangerous system commands
- Security attack patterns

"We built MUIN Guard to solve our own problem," said MJ, COO of MUIN. "As developers who use AI tools daily, we've all made mistakes - pasting API keys, sharing customer emails, exposing internal infrastructure. This tool prevents those mistakes before they happen."

**Key Features:**

- **100% Privacy-First**: All data processing happens locally in the browser. Zero server transmission.
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Optional WebGPU-based LLM analysis using Llama Guard 3
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent code under MIT license
- **Free Forever**: No cost for individual users

MUIN Guard is available now on the Chrome Web Store and supports ChatGPT, Claude, with Gemini support coming soon.

**About MUIN**

MUIN (무인기업, meaning "unmanned company") is an AI-first company building tools that make AI safer and more useful. With the tagline "AI Works, Humans Enjoy," MUIN is pioneering new approaches to AI security and privacy.

## 💬 Founder Quotes

### On the Problem
> "I personally lost $300 when I accidentally shared an OpenAI API key in ChatGPT. That's when I realized this isn't just my problem - it's everyone's problem. We talk to AI like we talk to colleagues, forgetting that these conversations might be stored forever."  
> — MJ, COO, MUIN

### On Privacy
> "Privacy isn't just a feature - it's our architecture. We built MUIN Guard so that even we, the developers, cannot access user data. It's not about trust; it's about impossibility."  
> — MJ, COO, MUIN

### On Open Source
> "Security tools should be transparent. You shouldn't have to trust us - you should be able to verify. That's why we're open source. Every line of code is auditable."  
> — MJ, COO, MUIN

### On the Vision
> "We're building the Norton of the AI era. Just as antivirus companies democratized PC security, we're making AI security accessible to everyone - starting with free tools for individuals."  
> — MJ, COO, MUIN

### On AI Safety
> "As AI becomes more powerful, we need better guardrails. But those guardrails shouldn't come from centralized servers analyzing your private conversations. They should run on your device, under your control."  
> — MJ, COO, MUIN

## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: Why did you build MUIN Guard?

**A:** I personally lost $300 when I accidentally pasted an OpenAI API key into ChatGPT. It was charged within hours. I realized this wasn't just my problem - as AI becomes ubiquitous, accidental data exposure is becoming a major risk. We built MUIN Guard to solve this systemically.

### Q: How is this different from existing security tools?

**A:** Traditional security tools focus on protecting your computer from external threats. MUIN Guard protects you from yourself - from accidental mistakes. Plus, it's 100% local. Most security tools send data to servers for analysis. We don't, and we can't.

### Q: Why make it free?

**A:** We're following the antivirus model - free for individuals, paid for enterprises. Personal security should be accessible to everyone. We'll monetize through enterprise features like team dashboards and compliance reporting.

### Q: Can you really not see user data?

**A:** No, we literally can't. There's no server infrastructure to receive data. Everything runs in your browser. Even if we wanted to spy, the architecture makes it impossible. That's by design.

### Q: Why open source?

**A:** Security tools require trust. The best way to build trust is to be completely transparent. Open source means anyone can audit our code, verify our claims, and even self-host if they want.

### Q: What's next for MUIN Guard?

**A:** Short term: Gemini support, Firefox version. Medium term: Enterprise dashboard with team management and compliance reporting. Long term: More AI platforms, mobile support, and deeper integrations.

### Q: How do you handle false positives?

**A:** Our detection is tuned to minimize false positives while catching real risks. Users can also dismiss alerts and customize sensitivity. The AI analysis layer helps reduce false positives for edge cases.

### Q: What about other AI platforms like Perplexity, Poe?

**A:** We started with the most popular platforms (ChatGPT, Claude) to validate the concept. We're prioritizing new platforms based on user demand. If you want support for a specific platform, request it on GitHub!

### Medium (100 words)
MUIN Guard is a privacy-first Chrome extension that prevents accidental data exposure during AI conversations. As millions of users rely on ChatGPT, Claude, and similar tools, the risk of sharing sensitive information - API keys, personal data, internal infrastructure details - has grown significantly. MUIN Guard addresses this with real-time detection of 30+ risk patterns, all processed locally in the browser. An optional WebGPU-based AI analysis layer provides deeper protection. Free for individual users and open source under MIT license, MUIN Guard represents a new approach to AI safety: protecting users from their own mistakes.

### Long (200 words)
MUIN Guard is a comprehensive privacy and security solution for AI conversations, launched in February 2026 by MUIN, an AI-first company based in Seoul, South Korea. As AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude become essential tools for millions of users worldwide, a new category of privacy risk has emerged: accidental exposure of sensitive information during casual AI interactions.

MUIN Guard addresses this through real-time monitoring and detection of 30+ risk patterns, including API keys (OpenAI, AWS, GitHub, Stripe), personal identifiable information (emails, phone numbers, credit cards), dangerous system commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE), and security attack patterns (SQL injection, XSS). The extension employs a privacy-first architecture where all data processing happens locally in the user's browser, with zero server transmission.

For advanced users, an optional WebGPU-based AI analysis layer using Llama Guard 3 provides deeper, context-aware protection - still entirely client-side. The tool features a beautiful dashboard for managing conversation history, viewing statistics, and customizing settings.

MUIN Guard is free forever for individual users and open source under MIT license, making it fully auditable and transparent. Enterprise features including team dashboards and compliance reporting are planned for future release. The extension currently supports ChatGPT and Claude, with Gemini support coming soon.
