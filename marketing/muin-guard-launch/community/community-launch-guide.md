### 2. Share on Social Media

**Twitter/X:**

**Option A - Personal story:**
```
Just installed @muin_company's MUIN Guard 🛡️

Almost shared my OpenAI API key in ChatGPT yesterday. This would've saved me 
from a $300+ mistake.

Free, open-source, runs 100% locally.

**Option B - Feature highlight:**

Detects when you're about to share:
• API keys
• Personal info
• Dangerous commands
• SQL injections

in ChatGPT/Claude conversations

Free forever, local-only processing

Try it: [link]
```

**Option C - Retweet & comment:**
```
Retweet MUIN's launch tweet and add:

"This is brilliant. We need more privacy-first tools like this. Installing now!"
```

**LinkedIn:**
```
Excited to see the launch of MUIN Guard - a Chrome extension that prevents 
accidental data leaks in AI conversations.

As AI tools like ChatGPT become essential for work, we need better safeguards 
against accidentally sharing:
• API keys and credentials
• Customer PII
• Internal infrastructure details
• Confidential information

What I love about MUIN Guard:
✅ 100% local processing (zero server transmission)
✅ Free for individual users
✅ Open source (fully auditable)
✅ AI-powered analysis via WebGPU

This is the kind of privacy-first innovation we need more of.

Hey everyone,

After accidentally pasting an API key into ChatGPT and getting charged $300, 
I built a tool to prevent this from happening again.

MUIN Guard detects sensitive info (API keys, PII, dangerous commands) in 
real-time and alerts you BEFORE you hit send.

Key features:
- 30+ detection patterns
- 100% local (zero server transmission)
- Optional AI analysis via WebGPU
- Free forever
- Open source (MIT)

I'd love feedback from this community! What patterns should we add?

```
Title: Show HN: MUIN Guard – Privacy shield for AI conversations

Body:
Hey HN,

I built MUIN Guard after accidentally leaking an OpenAI API key in ChatGPT.

It monitors your conversations with ChatGPT/Claude and alerts you before you share:
- API keys (OpenAI, AWS, GitHub, etc.)
- Personal information
- Dangerous commands
- Security vulnerabilities

Everything runs locally (WebGPU AI analysis, no servers), it's open source (MIT), 
and free forever for individuals.

Would love to hear HN's feedback on the approach and what other patterns to detect!
