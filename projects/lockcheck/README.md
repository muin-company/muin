Verify lockfile integrity. Detect suspicious registries, duplicate versions, missing hashes.

## Why?

Supply chain attacks are real. Lockfiles can contain packages from unexpected registries, missing integrity hashes, or other red flags that automated CI should catch before they hit production.

lockcheck does one thing well: scan your package-lock.json and warn you about potential security issues.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g lockcheck
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx lockcheck
```

## Usage

```bash
# Check current directory
lockcheck

# Check specific file
lockcheck ./path/to/package-lock.json

# Get JSON output
lockcheck --json

# Treat warnings as errors (for CI)
lockcheck --strict

# Check for drift (package.json vs lockfile mismatch) - NEW!
lockcheck --drift
```

## What it checks

- **Suspicious registries** - Packages not from registry.npmjs.org or registry.yarnpkg.com
- **Missing integrity hashes** - Packages without SHA verification
- **Duplicate versions** - Same package with multiple versions (bloats node_modules)
- **Version drift** (NEW with `--drift`) - Mismatches between package.json and lockfile versions

## Examples

### Example 1: Clean Project - All Good ✅

**Scenario:** Well-maintained project with standard dependencies.

```bash
$ cd my-clean-project
$ lockcheck

🔍 Scanning package-lock.json...

✅ Lockfile looks good!

📊 Summary:
  - Total packages: 342
  - Registries: 1 (registry.npmjs.org)
  - All integrity hashes present: ✓
  - No duplicate versions found: ✓

Exit code: 0
```

**Result:** Safe to deploy!

---

### Example 2: Suspicious Registry Detected 🚨

**Scenario:** A compromised dependency or typosquatting attempt.

```bash
$ lockcheck

🔍 Scanning package-lock.json...

⚠️  SECURITY WARNINGS:

🚨 Suspicious Registry:
  - evil-package@1.0.0
    Expected: https://registry.npmjs.org
    Found:    https://malicious-registry.com/evil-package/-/evil-package-1.0.0.tgz

    ⚠️  This package is NOT from the official npm registry!
    Risk: Supply chain attack, malware injection

🔍 Recommended Action:
  1. Check if this is a private/corporate registry (expected behavior)
  2. If not, REMOVE this package immediately
  3. Run `npm audit` and scan for malware
  4. Notify your security team

Exit code: 1
```

**Action:** Investigate and remove the suspicious package.

---

### Example 3: Missing Integrity Hashes

**Scenario:** Old lockfile or manually edited file missing SHA checksums.

```bash
$ lockcheck

🔍 Scanning package-lock.json...

⚠️  MISSING INTEGRITY HASHES:

❌ lodash@4.17.21 - No integrity hash found
❌ express@4.18.0 - No integrity hash found
❌ axios@1.3.0 - No integrity hash found

📊 Summary:
  - Total packages: 89
  - Missing integrity: 3

⚠️  Without integrity hashes, npm cannot verify package contents!
    This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks or corrupted packages.

🔧 Fix:
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install

Exit code: 1
```

---

### Example 4: Duplicate Versions Bloating node_modules

**Scenario:** Different versions of the same package installed, wasting space.

```bash
$ lockcheck

🔍 Scanning package-lock.json...

⚠️  DUPLICATE VERSIONS:

📦 lodash found in 3 different versions:
  - 4.17.20 (used by: webpack, babel-core)
  - 4.17.21 (used by: express, mocha)
  - 3.10.1 (used by: legacy-lib)

📦 moment found in 2 different versions:
  - 2.29.1 (used by: react-datepicker)
  - 2.30.0 (used by: chart.js)

📊 Impact:
  - Extra disk space: ~450 KB
  - Potential bugs from version mismatch

💡 Fix:
  npm dedupe  # Attempts to flatten dependency tree
  # Or update dependencies to use consistent versions

Exit code: 0 (warning only)
```

---

### Example 5: Version Drift Detection (NEW!)

**Scenario:** Detect when package.json and lockfile versions don't match.

```bash
$ lockcheck --drift

🔍 Scanning package-lock.json...
🔍 Comparing with package.json...

⚠️  VERSION DRIFT DETECTED:

📦 react: 
   package.json: ^18.2.0
   lockfile:     17.0.2
   ❌ Lockfile version doesn't satisfy package.json range!

📦 axios:
   package.json: ^1.4.0
   lockfile:     1.3.0
   ❌ Lockfile version is outdated!

📦 typescript:
   ❌ Listed in package.json but missing from lockfile!

📊 Drift Summary:
  - Version mismatches: 2
  - Missing in lockfile: 1
  - Total drift issues: 3

💡 Recommended Fix:
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
  npm install

This ensures your lockfile is regenerated from package.json.

Exit code: 1 (warnings found)
```

**Why drift happens:**
- Manual edits to package.json without running `npm install`
- Switching branches without updating dependencies
- Corrupted or stale lockfile
- Dependencies added/removed but not committed

**When to use --drift:**
- Before deploying to catch stale lockfiles
- In CI to enforce consistency
- After merging branches with dependency changes
- When debugging "works on my machine" issues

---

### Example 6: CI Enforcement with --strict Mode

**Scenario:** Block any lockfile issues in your CI pipeline.

```bash
$ lockcheck --strict

🔍 Scanning package-lock.json...

⚠️  Warnings found (treated as errors in --strict mode):

  - Package lodash has 2 different versions: 4.17.20, 4.17.21
  - Package moment has 2 different versions: 2.29.1, 2.30.0

❌ FAILED: 2 warnings in --strict mode

Exit code: 1  ← Build fails
```

**GitHub Actions Example:**

```yaml
- name: Check lockfile
  run: npx lockcheck --strict
```

**Result:** PR is blocked until duplicates are resolved.

---

### Example 6: JSON Output for Automation

**Scenario:** Integrate lockcheck results into your security dashboard.

```bash
$ lockcheck --json > lockfile-report.json
```

**Output (`lockfile-report.json`):**

```json
{
  "passed": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "suspicious_registry",
      "package": "evil-package",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "registry": "https://malicious-registry.com",
      "expected": "https://registry.npmjs.org"
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "type": "duplicate_version",
      "package": "lodash",
      "versions": ["4.17.20", "4.17.21"]
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "totalPackages": 342,
    "registries": [
      "https://registry.npmjs.org",
      "https://malicious-registry.com"
    ],
    "missingIntegrity": 0,
    "duplicates": 1
  }
}
```

**Use case:** Parse JSON, send alerts to Slack/PagerDuty if `passed: false`.

## CI Integration

Add to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Check lockfile integrity
  run: npx lockcheck --strict
```

Exit code is 0 if passed, 1 if errors found. Perfect for blocking bad merges.

## API

Use programmatically:

```typescript
import { checkLockfileFromPath } from 'lockcheck';

const result = checkLockfileFromPath('./package-lock.json', {
  strict: true,
  allowedRegistries: ['https://registry.npmjs.org']
});

if (!result.passed) {
  console.error('Issues found:', result.errors);
}
```

## Options

- `--json` - Output results as JSON
- `--strict` - Treat warnings as errors (fails with exit code 1)
- `--help` - Show help

## Real-World Examples

### 1. CI/CD Security Gate

**GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'package-lock.json'
      - 'yarn.lock'

jobs:
  lockfile-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Verify lockfile integrity
        run: npx lockcheck --strict
      
      - name: Block merge on suspicious packages
        if: failure()
        run: |
          echo "❌ Lockfile contains security issues"
          echo "Review registry sources and missing hashes"
          exit 1
```

**GitLab CI:**

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
lockfile-audit:
  stage: security
  script:
    - npx lockcheck --strict
  only:
    changes:
      - package-lock.json
  allow_failure: false
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hook

Catch lockfile issues before they're committed:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "package-lock.json"; then
  echo "🔍 Checking lockfile integrity..."
  npx lockcheck --strict
  
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Lockfile has issues. Fix before committing."
    exit 1
  fi
  
  echo "✅ Lockfile is clean"
fi
```

With husky:

```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lockcheck --strict"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Monorepo Scanning

Check all lockfiles in a monorepo:

```bash
# Find and check all lockfiles
find . -name "package-lock.json" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | while read lockfile; do
  echo "Checking $lockfile"
  lockcheck "$lockfile" --strict
done

# Or with parallel processing
find . -name "package-lock.json" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | \
  parallel lockcheck {} --strict
```

### 4. Custom Registry Whitelist

For organizations using private registries:

```bash
# Allow specific registries (feature request - example config)
# lockcheck.config.json
{
  "allowedRegistries": [
    "https://registry.npmjs.org",
    "https://npm.internal.company.com",
    "https://artifacts.company.io"
  ],
  "strict": true
}

# Then run
lockcheck --config lockcheck.config.json
```

### 5. Automated Dependency Updates

Combine with Dependabot or Renovate:

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    reviewers:
      - "security-team"
    # After Dependabot creates PR, lockcheck runs automatically
```

GitHub Action to verify Dependabot PRs:

```yaml
name: Verify Dependency Updates

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  check-deps:
    if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Verify lockfile
        run: npx lockcheck --strict
      
      - name: Auto-merge if safe
        if: success()
        run: gh pr merge --auto --squash ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### 6. JSON Output for Reporting

Generate security reports:

```bash
# Generate JSON report
lockcheck --json > lockfile-report.json

# Parse with jq
lockcheck --json | jq '.errors'

# Count issues
lockcheck --json | jq '.errors | length'

# Alert if issues found
lockcheck --json | jq -e '.passed == false' && \
  curl -X POST https://alerts.company.com/webhook \
  -d "Lockfile security issues detected"
```

### 7. Periodic Security Audits

Weekly lockfile health checks:

```bash
# crontab
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && lockcheck --json > reports/lockcheck-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).json

# GitHub Actions scheduled scan
# .github/workflows/weekly-audit.yml
name: Weekly Security Audit

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 9 AM

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run lockfile check
        run: lockcheck --json > lockcheck-report.json
      
      - name: Upload report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: lockfile-audit
          path: lockcheck-report.json
      
      - name: Notify on Slack if issues
        if: failure()
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }} \
          -d '{"text":"⚠️ Weekly lockfile audit found issues"}'
```

### 8. Emergency Response

When a supply chain attack is detected:

```bash
# Quick scan across all projects
for repo in ~/projects/*/; do
  if [ -f "$repo/package-lock.json" ]; then
    echo "Scanning $repo"
    lockcheck "$repo/package-lock.json" --strict || echo "⚠️  Issue in $repo"
  fi
done

# Generate org-wide report
for repo in ~/projects/*/; do
  if [ -f "$repo/package-lock.json" ]; then
    echo "$repo" >> org-report.txt
    lockcheck "$repo/package-lock.json" --json >> org-report.txt
  fi
done
```
