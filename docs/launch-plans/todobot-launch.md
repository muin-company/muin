### Technical Issues

**If Service Goes Down:**

2. PH comment explaining situation
3. Twitter update with transparency
4. Offer extended trial/bonus to affected users
5. Post-mortem blog post (turns negative into content)

**If Overwhelming Response:**
1. Graceful degradation (disable non-critical features)
2. Queue system for new signups
3. Communicate clearly about wait times
4. Collect emails for batch onboarding

### Negative Feedback Handling
