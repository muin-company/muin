## Phase 4: Instagram Graph API Strategy

   - Provide step-by-step conversion guide
   - Video tutorial

2. **Facebook Page Connection Required**
   - Workaround: Auto-create page flow
   - Explain why it's needed
   - No posting to FB page (reassure users)

3. **Rate Limits**
   - Workaround: Smart batching
   - Queue system
   - User notifications if delayed

4. **Permission Scopes**
   - Required: `instagram_basic`, `instagram_manage_comments`, `pages_show_list`
   - Clear permission explanation
   - Reassure about data privacy

### API Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Beta)

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Post-Beta)
- [ ] Sentiment analysis
- [ ] Auto-categorization
- [ ] DM integration (if Meta approves)
- [ ] Story mention replies

- [ ] **Rate Limit Handling** (exponential backoff)
- [ ] **Error Logging** (track API failures)
- [ ] **Webhook Setup** (real-time comment notifications)
- [ ] **Regular API Health Checks**

### Backup Plan (If API Issues)

**Plan A: Manual Mode**
- Chrome extension for web-based replies
- Copy-paste workflow
- Still AI-powered, just not auto

**Plan B: Email Digest**
- Daily summary of comments
- AI suggestions sent via email
- User replies manually, copy-paste AI text

**Plan C: Alternative Platform**

- YouTube comments (public API)
