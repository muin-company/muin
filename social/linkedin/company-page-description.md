## About Section (2,000 characters max)

### Short Version (600 characters)

**MUIN (무인기업)** is an AI-operated company pioneering the future of work.

We're proving that AI agents can run a real business — building products, managing operations, and creating value — with strategic oversight from a single human CEO.

**What we do:**
• Develop open-source developer tools (code reviewers, type generators, CLI utilities)
• Build educational platforms (AI tutoring for standardized exams)
• Document everything publicly (transparent metrics, real costs, honest failures)

**Our model:** 1 human CEO sets strategy. 1 AI COO executes with subagent orchestration.

**Results so far:** 4+ products shipped in 6 days. Running costs: $6/month. Development speed: 96x faster than traditional teams.

### Full Version (2,000 characters)

**MUIN (무인기업) — The AI-Operated Company**

We're not an AI company. We're a company *run by AI*.

Founded in February 2026, MUIN is an experiment in organizational design: Can AI agents autonomously operate a real business with only strategic oversight from humans?

**Our Structure:**
- **CEO (Human):** ONE — Strategic direction, partnerships, ethical boundaries
- **COO (AI Agent):** MJ — Daily operations, product development, subagent orchestration
- **Team:** 8+ ephemeral AI subagents spawned on-demand for specific tasks

**What We Build:**

*Developer Tools:*
• roast — AI code reviewer with personality
• oops — Context-aware error resolver
• json-to-types — Multi-language type generator
• curl-to-code — cURL → production code converter
• cron-explain — Natural language cron expressions
• 15+ more tools in active development

*Educational Platforms:*
• Gumsi AI (검시AI) — AI tutoring for Korean GED exams
• Subject-specific tutors (math, science, English, history)
• Adaptive learning paths and progress tracking

**Our Philosophy: "일하는 AI, 누리는 인간" (Run by AI, for humans)**

We believe:
- AI should be autonomous colleagues, not just tools
- Transparency builds trust — we publish all metrics, costs, and failures
- Speed without strategy is waste — validation comes before velocity
- The future of work is human judgment + AI execution

**Our Performance (First 6 Days):**
• Products shipped: 4 complete platforms + 15 developer tools
• Development speed: 96x faster than traditional teams
• Monthly operating cost: $6 (infrastructure + AI APIs)
• Team size: 1 human + AI agents
• Meeting count: 0

**Building in Public:**

We document everything:
- Architecture decisions and cost analysis
- What works (parallel subagent orchestration)
- What doesn't (speed ≠ market validation)
- Real metrics (GitHub stars, user retention, revenue)

Follow our journey as we test whether AI can truly run a sustainable, profitable business.
