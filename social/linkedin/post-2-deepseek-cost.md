# LinkedIn Post 2: Why We Chose DeepSeek Over GPT-4 (And Saved 98%)

---

**We just launched an AI tutoring platform that costs $5/month to run.**

Not $5/month per user. $5/month *total* — for 100+ users.

Here's how the math broke every investor's assumption about AI startups:

---

## The Cost Comparison

**Gumsi AI** (our Korean GED exam prep platform):
- 6 subject-specific AI tutors
- Real-time chat with streaming responses
- Personalized learning path tracking
- ~1M tokens/month (100 active users)

**If we'd used GPT-4:**

→ $15/1M tokens  
→ Monthly cost: **$15**  
→ At 10K users: **$1,500/month**

**With DeepSeek:**

→ $0.14/1M tokens  
→ Monthly cost: **$0.14**  
→ At 10K users: **$14/month**

**Savings: 99.1% vs GPT-4**

## "But DeepSeek Must Be Worse, Right?"

That's what we thought.

We ran head-to-head tests:

**Where DeepSeek matches GPT-4:**
✅ Code generation & debugging  
✅ Math tutoring (step-by-step reasoning)  
✅ Conversational flow  
✅ Factual knowledge retrieval  
✅ Structured output (JSON, schemas)

**Where GPT-4 still leads:**
• Nuanced creative writing  
• Highly ambiguous problem-solving  
• Specialized domains (medical, legal)

For developer tools and education — our core products — **DeepSeek delivers equivalent quality at 1/100th the cost.**

---

## What This Changes

**Old AI startup playbook:**
1. Raise $2M seed round  
2. Half goes to OpenAI API costs  
3. Pray for revenue before burn rate kills you  

**New playbook:**
1. Bootstrap on $50/month  
2. Run free beta indefinitely  
3. Break even at $100 MRR  
4. Raise only for distribution, not infrastructure  

---

## The Strategic Implications

**For startups:**
- You can launch 10 AI experiments for $50/month  
- Freemium becomes default (cost allows it)  
- Product-market fit testing is nearly free  

**For VCs:**
- "AI infrastructure costs" is no longer a valid moat  
- Distribution and retention become the only metrics that matter  
- Less capital required = more competition = higher bar  

**For enterprises:**
- Internal AI tools no longer require budget approval  
- Departmental AI pilots become $10/month instead of $10K/month  
- The "AI ROI" conversation completely changes  

---

## The Catch

DeepSeek isn't perfect for everything.

**Don't use DeepSeek for:**
- Brand-critical customer-facing content (GPT-4's "polish" matters here)  
- High-stakes legal/medical advice  
- Complex multi-agent reasoning (Claude Opus is better)

**Do use DeepSeek for:**
- Developer tooling (our specialty)  
- Educational content  
- Data analysis and structured extraction  
- High-volume, cost-sensitive applications

## Our Full Stack Cost Breakdown

**Gumsi AI (100 users/month):**

| Service | Tier | Cost |
|---------|------|------|
| Vercel (hosting) | Free | $0 |
| Supabase (DB + Auth) | Free | $0 |
| DeepSeek API | PAYG | $5 |
| Domain | Owned | $1/mo |
| **Total** | | **$6/month** |

Compare to a traditional SaaS:
- AWS: $50-200/month  
- Auth0: $23/month  
- OpenAI: $100+/month  
- **Total: $200-400/month**

**We're running at 3-5% of traditional costs.**

And we haven't even optimized yet.

## The Uncomfortable Question

If API costs drop 99%...

And development time drops 96% (see our previous post on parallel agents)...

**What's actually expensive anymore?**

Answer: **Customer acquisition.**

Building is cheap. Distribution is the entire game.

Which means:

→ Engineering-heavy teams become over-capitalized  
→ Growth/marketing becomes the core competency  
→ "Can you build it?" becomes irrelevant. "Will anyone use it?" is everything  

---

## What We're Testing

At MUIN, we're tracking:

**Hypothesis:** DeepSeek's cost efficiency lets us run profitable businesses at tiny scale.

**Metrics:**
- Break-even MRR: $50 (vs. $5K+ for GPT-4 version)  
- Free tier sustainability: Unlimited (cost is negligible)  
- Profit margin at $19.99/month pricing: ~98%  

**Risk:** If 10K+ users hit us overnight, can DeepSeek's API scale?

**Status:** 6 days in. 50 beta users. No issues yet.

**Update in 30 days.**

---

## The Reality Check

This isn't "DeepSeek is better than GPT-4."

This is "**cost structures are shifting so dramatically that the entire startup playbook needs rewriting.**"

In 2023, you needed $2M to build an AI company.

In 2026, you need $50.

The barrier to entry just evaporated.

Which means competition intensifies.

Which means the only moat is:
• Distribution
• Brand trust  
• Network effects  
• Proprietary data  

Code is no longer defensible. Neither is infrastructure.

**The question isn't "can you build it?" anymore.**

**It's "why should anyone care?"**
