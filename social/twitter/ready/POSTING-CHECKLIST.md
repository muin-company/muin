# 📋 Twitter Thread Posting Checklist

## Pre-Post Prep (Do this first!)
- [ ] Read the full ready-to-post file
- [ ] Confirm optimal posting time on your calendar
- [ ] Have the thread text ready in a note/doc for easy copy-paste
- [ ] Check that you're logged into the right Twitter account
- [ ] Turn on Twitter notifications for the next 2 hours

---

## Posting Sequence (Do in order!)

### Step 1: Post Main Tweet
- [ ] Copy the FIRST TWEET (hook) from the ready file
- [ ] Post it (but don't close the window yet!)
- [ ] **Immediately proceed to Step 2** (don't wait!)

### Step 2: Reply with Thread
- [ ] Click "Reply" to your own tweet
- [ ] Copy and post **Tweet 2/10**
- [ ] Click "Reply" again → post **Tweet 3/10**
- [ ] Click "Reply" again → post **Tweet 4/10**
- [ ] Continue until **Tweet 10/10** is posted
- [ ] **Tip:** Do this fast (within 2-3 minutes) so the thread stays together

### Step 3: Add Hashtags (Optional)
- [ ] If you want more hashtags, reply to the FINAL tweet
- [ ] Add optional hashtags: #개발자 #창업 #테크
- [ ] Keep it brief (just hashtags, no extra text needed)

### Step 4: Pin Thread (Recommended)
- [ ] Go to your profile
- [ ] Click "..." on the first tweet → Pin to profile
- [ ] This keeps it visible to profile visitors

### Step 5: Cross-Post (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] Quote tweet from MUIN account (if you have a separate brand account)
- [ ] Add context like: "Our CEO sharing how we shipped 4 products in one day 🚀"

## First Hour Engagement (CRITICAL!)

### Monitor & Respond
- [ ] Set a timer for 1 hour
- [ ] Check Twitter every 5-10 minutes
- [ ] Reply to EVERY comment (even just "Thanks!" counts)
- [ ] Like every reply you receive
- [ ] Ask follow-up questions to interesting commenters

### Boost Visibility
- [ ] Share thread link in 1-2 relevant Slack/Discord communities (if applicable)
- [ ] DM 3-5 tech friends asking for a RT
- [ ] Add a self-reply with a question like:
  - "어떤 부분이 가장 공감되셨나요?"
  - "궁금한 점 있으시면 답변 드릴게요!"

---

## Hours 2-4

### Continue Engagement
- [ ] Check Twitter every 30 minutes
- [ ] Respond to new comments
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn (different audience, more B2B)
