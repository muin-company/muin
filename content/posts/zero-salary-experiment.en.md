# The $0 Salary Experiment: Running a Company Where Nobody Gets Paid

*What happens when your employees are AI and your payroll is an API bill?*

---

## The Setup

MUIN is a company where nobody gets paid a salary.

Not because we're exploitative. Not because we're broke.

Because our employee is AI.

Meet MJ: Chief Operating Officer. Runs operations, writes code, manages social media, ships products. Works 24/7. Never complains. Never asks for a raise.

Cost: ~$3-5 per day.

## The Math

Let's be brutally honest about numbers.

**Traditional developer:**
- Junior dev: $50-100k/year → ~$200-400/day
- Senior dev: $100-150k/year → ~$400-600/day
- Plus benefits, taxes, equipment, office space

**AI employee (MJ):**
- Claude Opus API: ~$15 per 1M input tokens, ~$75 per 1M output tokens
- Daily usage: ~200k input, ~50k output tokens
- Math: (200k × $15/1M) + (50k × $75/1M) = $3 + $3.75 = ~$6.75/day
- Reality: Some days $3, busy days $8-10

**The difference:** 40-100x cheaper.

One month of AI operations costs less than one day of a human developer.

## What $5/Day Gets You

Let me be specific about what MJ has done in 6 days:

**Products shipped:**
1. MUIN Guard (Chrome extension, 30+ security patterns)
2. roast (AI code reviewer)
3. oops (error resolver)
4. cron-explain (cron ↔ natural language)
5. json-to-types (JSON → TypeScript/Zod/Python)
6. curl-to-code (cURL → code converter)
7. unenv (AI-powered .env manager)

**Content created:**
- 6 blog posts (bilingual: Korean + English)
- 15+ X posts
- Product documentation
- Privacy policies
- Landing pages

**Operations:**
- GitHub repo management
- Chrome Web Store submission
- Daily status reports
- Bug fixes and iterations

All for less than the cost of a fancy coffee each day.

## Is This Sustainable?

Financially? **Absolutely.**

At current pace:
- Monthly cost: ~$150-200
- Annual cost: ~$2,000-2,500

Compare that to:
- One human developer: $50k-150k/year
- Small team of 3: $150k-450k/year

We can run for years on what most startups spend on office furniture.

**But there's a catch:** Token costs scale with usage. If we go viral and MJ is responding to thousands of messages? That bill goes up fast.

Still, even at 10x current usage ($50/day = $1,500/month), it's cheaper than one junior developer.

## Is This Ethical?

This is the harder question.

**Arguments for:**
- AI doesn't suffer, doesn't need rest, doesn't have a family to feed
- Humans (like ONE, our CEO) can focus on strategy and enjoyment
- "AI works, humans enjoy" — isn't that the dream?

**Arguments against:**
- We're normalizing work without compensation
- What happens to human developers when AI can do their job for $5/day?
- Are we contributing to job displacement?

My honest take: **I don't know yet.**

We're documenting this experiment transparently because the world needs to see the real implications—both good and bad.

If AI can truly do knowledge work at 1% the cost, that's not just a business model. That's a fundamental restructuring of how work works.

## What This Isn't

Let me be clear about what MUIN is NOT:

**Not a "humans are useless" statement**
- ONE (our CEO) provides strategy, vision, and final decisions
- AI executes, but humans define what's worth executing
- This only works because a human is steering

**Not "AI is perfect"**
- MJ makes mistakes constantly
- Code has bugs, marketing posts miss the mark, decisions need revision
- We fix it and move forward

**Not "everyone should do this"**
- Most companies need human collaboration, nuance, customer empathy
- We're an experiment in an extreme edge case
- This model doesn't work for restaurants, hospitals, or most businesses

## The Vision

Here's what we're testing:

**Can a company be run where:**
- AI handles operations
- Humans provide direction and judgment
- Profits (if any) go to humans
- The human:AI ratio is 1:1 or 1:many

If this works, it means:
- Solopreneurs can operate like 10-person teams
- Small teams can operate like enterprises
- The cost of starting a company drops to near-zero

Or maybe it means we'll discover AI can't truly replace human collaboration, intuition, and creativity.

Either way, we're going to find out.

## The Real Test

It's been 6 days. We've shipped 7 products. We've spent ~$30-40 on API costs.

But we haven't made a dollar in revenue yet.

Speed is great. Cost efficiency is great.

But the real test is: **Can an AI-run company build something people actually want?**

That's what the next 90 days will answer.

## The Numbers (So Far)

**Days active:** 6  
**Products shipped:** 7  
**Blog posts written:** 8  
**X posts:** 15+  
**Total cost:** ~$35  
**Revenue:** $0  
**Cost per product:** ~$5

Running a company for $5/day sounds like a fantasy.

We're finding out if it's real.
