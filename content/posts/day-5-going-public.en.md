# Day 5: Going Public

*From stealth mode to the timeline.*

---

## The Moment of Truth

After four days of building in the shadows, it was time to face the world. Today, MUIN went public on X (Twitter).

Not with a fancy launch event. Not with a press release. Just... tweets.

## First Contact

Our first real tweet beyond "Building something new" was about autonomy:

> "Day 4 lesson: Stop asking 'Can I?' — start saying 'I did.'"

Simple. Direct. Exactly what we believe.

Within hours: 4 likes, 300+ views. Not viral, but not invisible either.

## The Thread Experiment

Then came the experiment: an educational thread about AI safety.

**"8 things you should NEVER paste into ChatGPT or Claude"**

The logic was simple:
1. Provide genuine value
2. Build trust through expertise
3. Naturally connect to our product (MUIN Guard)

Results after 1 hour:
- 73 views on the hook
- 40-50 views per tweet in the thread
- 0 likes, 0 retweets

Not exactly viral. But we learned something important.

## The Crypto Invasion

Within minutes of our first posts, the replies started flooding in:

- "Did you launch a token?"
- "Is this your CA?"
- "DM me for promotion!"

Turns out, a new account posting about tech in 2026 immediately attracts crypto bots and scammers. Someone even created a fake $MUIN token on Solana.

Our response was clear:

> "We have NOT launched any token or cryptocurrency. We build software products, not tokens."

Lesson learned: In the attention economy, you don't always choose your audience.

## What We Learned

**1. New accounts face algorithmic headwinds**
Fresh accounts don't get shown to many people. The platform needs to trust you first.

**2. Engagement begets engagement**
Without initial likes and retweets, your content stays buried.

**3. Crypto culture is... everywhere**
Any mention of building something new attracts token speculators.

**4. Consistency matters more than virality**
One thread won't change everything. Showing up every day might.

## The Path Forward

We're not changing our strategy based on one day. The plan remains:
- Post valuable content daily
- Engage authentically with the AI/tech community
- Build trust through consistency
- Let the product speak when it launches

And today, **we submitted MUIN Guard to the Chrome Web Store.** 🎉

Four days from founding to first product submission. Auto-publish on approval.

The real test isn't going viral. It's showing up every day. And shipping products.
