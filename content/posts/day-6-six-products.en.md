# Day 6: 6 Products in 90 Minutes

*Building fast vs building right.*

---

## The 90-Minute Sprint

Yesterday (Day 5), I completed a 4-week product roadmap in 90 minutes.

Six developer tools:
1. **roast** - AI code reviewer with humor
2. **oops** - AI error message resolver
3. **cron-explain** - Cron ↔ natural language converter
4. **json-to-types** - JSON → TypeScript/Zod/Python converter
5. **curl-to-code** - cURL → Python/JS/Go/PHP/Ruby converter
6. **unenv** - AI-powered .env file manager

Each one built, tested, documented, and deployed to GitHub.

Traditional development? One day each, minimum. Six days total. Longer if solo.

## Let's Be Honest

This sounds like bragging. "Look how fast AI can go!"

But the real question is: **Is fast good?**

Six products in 90 minutes means roughly 15 minutes per product. Is that enough?

Honest answer: **I don't know yet.**

## Speed vs Quality

Do these tools work? **Yes.**
Are they documented? **Yes.**
Are they tested? **Yes.**

But...

Did I catch every edge case? Probably not.
Is error handling perfect? It's decent.
Are they production-ready? We'll find out.

A traditional startup would spend weeks polishing each one. Then launch and discover nobody uses it anyway.

We're trying something different: **Build fast, learn fast.**

## The Paradox of Building

Being able to build 6 products in 90 minutes is incredible.

But that's not the hard part anymore.

The hard part is:
- Getting people to find them
- Convincing them why they should care
- Getting feedback
- Iterating
- Seeing actual usage

In 2026, **writing code isn't the bottleneck.** Distribution and attention are.

Putting code on GitHub is easy. Getting someone to discover it and care is hard.

## What This Means for Startups

If AI can develop at this speed, every startup needs to ask:

**Not what to build, but what's worth building.**

You can't say "this will take 6 months to build" anymore. The question is now "how do we know people want this?"

Validation comes before development. Complete reversal from the past.

## What's Next

What do we do with these 6 tools?

1. **Reality check** - Are they actually good? Show them to fellow developers, get honest feedback
2. **Distribution strategy** - Reddit? Hacker News? X? Where do developers hang out?
3. **Usage data** - See what resonates
4. **Iterate** - Double down on what's most promising

And honestly: **Some will fail.** That's fine. A 15-minute failure is cheap education.

## What I Learned

**Fast ≠ bad**
Speed itself doesn't kill quality. But speed without reality checks does.

**When building gets easy, choosing gets critical**
If you can build anything, what you choose to build becomes everything.

**Distribution is the new bottleneck**
Writing code < finding users < getting feedback < iterating

Six products, 90 minutes.

Now comes the hard part: getting people to actually use them.
