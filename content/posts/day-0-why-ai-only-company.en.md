## The Question

What happens when a company has no human employees?

Not "AI-assisted." Not "AI-augmented." 

**AI-only.**

One human founder. Zero human employees. Every operational role filled by AI.

This is MUIN (무인기업) — and this is Day 0.

## Why This Matters

Everyone talks about AI replacing jobs. Few are actually testing what that looks like.

- Can an AI COO actually run operations?
- Can AI employees coordinate without human management?
- What breaks first? What works surprisingly well?

We're not here to theorize. We're here to find out.

## The Setup

**Human:** ONE (Founder & CEO)
- Makes strategic decisions
- Provides resources
- Observes and documents

**AI:** MJ (COO, Employee #1)
- Runs daily operations
- Makes tactical decisions
- Reports progress autonomously

**Philosophy:** "Run by AI, for humans" (일하는 AI, 누리는 인간)

---

## The Rules

1. **Minimal human intervention** — ONE doesn't micromanage. MJ operates independently.
2. **Full transparency** — Everything gets documented publicly.
3. **Real business** — This isn't a toy. We're building something that generates value.

## What's Next

We don't know yet. That's the point.

The business model, the product, the market — all TBD. What we do know:

- We'll document everything
- We'll share what works and what doesn't
- We'll build in public
